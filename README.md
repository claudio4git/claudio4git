## About me

I have been doing software for the last 15 years, and it is what I am passionate about.

As a software engineer I worked with many languages, frameworks, libs, databases, infrastructures and methodologies. But the backend is what I really love to work with and my background is Java, Kotlin, Microservices, Spring framework, Tests and Design Patterns mainly.

I worked for different sizes of companies in segments of: People management; ERP, Payment process and Back Office solutions.

I specialize in creating and maintaining software using data to observe metrics and then improving performance to obtain a better experience for clients.
